Google Chrome Remote Shell is basically API for running Google Chrome. It allows
you to connect to Google Chrome and run javascript instructions on your 
instance, like opening windows and probably controlling DOM elements.

This is a Python library for controlling Google Chrome.

First run:
$ google-chrome --remote-shell-port=9222

CAUTION: External users might connect to your Google Chrome after running 
this and run stuff in Chrome, so use firewall.

WARNING: You SHOULD have some real web page open in Chrome before trying
to evaluate expressions (not some extension page, otherwise sometimes remote 
shell waits indefinitely), so even better run:

$ google-chrome --remote-shell-port=9222 http://google.com/


Then you can use ChromeRemoteShell form Python:

    from ChromeRemoteShell import ChromeRemoteShell
    crs = ChromeRemoteShell()
    
    # crs.verbose = True
    # set .verbose = True to see all communications with Chrome Remote Shell
    
    # Get all Tabs
    tab = crs.tabs()[0]
    print tab

    # crs.v8_evaluate_js() doesn't return anything (by design [1], see below for 
    # expressions to get things back) 
    tab.v8_evaluate_js('window.open("http://www.google.com/webhp ");')
    # A space here was not needed (it's here due to bug in GitHub URL parsing)

    # Give it a time to open
    import time; time.sleep(.2) 
    
    # Find new tab
    tab = crs.tab_by_url('http://www.google.com/webhp')

    # Attach to V8 engine debugger
    tab.v8_attach()

    # Evaluate expression 1+2
    print tab.v8_eval_expr('1+2') # prints 3

    # Error handling 1+x (x is undefined)
    try:
        tab.v8_eval_expr('1+x') # raises Exception with description
    except Exception:
        pass

    # Control dom with document.*
    tab.v8_evaluate_js('document.write("This was written with '
                       'ChromeRemoteShell");')


    # Detach from V8
    tab.v8_detach()
